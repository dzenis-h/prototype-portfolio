        It's an EMS software - [Employee management system] that can help
        companies reduce their time spent on salaries, penalties, bonuses, and a
        lot of other things regarding the accounting department. Besides that,
        it can help with various tasks regarding the HR department [adding a new
        employee is only a few clicks away, and giving an end date is only a
        click away]. It contains many other features, like providing loans to

        hidden from the end-user, so it always appears easy to use, no matter
